Pixel Arrays is a method for returning solution sets to systems of
equations, as described by Spivak et al. in [1].

This is a work in progress proof-of-concept implementation of the method,
as part of an undergraduate research project by Lawrence Wu.

In this research, we hope to explore implementation speed and accuracy
guarantees. Several implementations will be tested in this repository.
